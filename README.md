## KDD Cup 2001- Mining Biological Databases 
KDD Cup 2001 was focused on data from genomics and drug design. Sufficient (yet concise) information was provided so that detailed domain knowledge was not a requirement for entry. A total of 136 groups participated to produce a total of 200 submitted predictions over the 3 tasks: 114 for Thrombin, 41 for Function, and 45 for Localization.
